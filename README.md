> '[What is a good directory structure for a monorepo with a Node.js back end and React front end?](https://simonplend.com/what-is-a-good-directory-structure-for-a-monorepo-with-a-node-js-back-end-and-react-front-end/)'.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= v12

## Application structure

- `client/` directory - React front end code.
- `server/` directory - Node.js back end code.
- `static/` directory - Compiled front end assets. Created by webpack when you
  run the command `npm run build`. The Node.js back end serves serves these
  assets using the
  [`express.static`](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html#serving-static-files-in-express)
  middleware.

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies for front end and back end
npm install

# Build front end assets with webpack
npm run build

# Run Node.js back end server
npm start
```

## Libraries and frameworks used

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - "Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web
  framework for Node.js".

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - "A JavaScript library for building user
  interfaces".

- [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) - A popular tool for building
  front end assets e.g. CSS and JavaScript.

- [Sucrase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sucrase) - A simpler and faster
  alternative to [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) which brings support for JSX,
  TypeScript, ES modules, and more to your client side and server side
  JavaScript.

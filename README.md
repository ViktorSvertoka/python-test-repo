# Test repo

## Linux OS Assignment: Find Users with /bin/bash Shell

This repository contains a script (`find_bash_users.sh`) that identifies all
users with the `/bin/bash` shell in a Linux system.

### Script Overview

The script reads the `/etc/passwd` file and extracts the usernames of all users
who have `/bin/bash` as their shell. The script then outputs these usernames.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make the script executable:

```bash
   chmod +x find_bash_users.sh
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
   ./find_bash_users.sh
```

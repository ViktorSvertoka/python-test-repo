# Description
This project is the Node.js backend part of an educational  project. It provides connection to DB, implements CRUD operations and sends responses to requests. 
## Setup
To set up the project, first run `npm install` then you can start server using `npm start -- --p 5000 --cp 3000` or `node index.js --p 5000 --cp 3000`, where `--p` is server port and `--cp` is client port. Alternatively, you can use .env file to configure the ports. The variables in the `.env` file are `PORT`and `CLIENT_PORT`. In order to obtain a configuration file, you can rename the [.env.example](./.env.example) into `.env`. 

Good luck!
